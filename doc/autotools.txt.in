=======================================
Installation on Linux, Unix and similar
=======================================

The @PACKAGE_NAME@ uses the GNU Build System to compile and install. If you are
unfamiliar with it, please have a look at :file:`INSTALL`. If you can not find
it, you are probably working bleeding edge in the repository. To generate the
missing standard auxiliary files you need to additionally install `libtool` and
`pkg-config` and run the following command in :file:`@PACKAGE_TARNAME@`::

    autoreconf --verbose --install

To configure (:command:`configure --help` lists possible options), build and
install the @PACKAGE_NAME@ now do the following::
    
    ./configure@RECOMMENDED_CONF_OPTS@
    make
    make install
